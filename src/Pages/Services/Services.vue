              Randall, the owner of Artisanal Restoration, will respond to discuss your project, answer questions, and schedule an on-site consultation at your home;
              you will then discuss a plan of work, project schedule, and budget.
            </li>
            <li>
              Randall performs the work himself at your home, bringing the necessary tools and materials with him in his pickup truck and packing up at the end of the day.
              He always comes with his trusty vacuum and cleans up throughout the work dayâ€”many clients report returning to such clean homes that they hardly believe they had construction work performed earlier that day.
            </li>
            <li>
              Randall will be communicative and accessible throughout the project, offering suggestions on design, how to do the work faithfully to the character and time period of your home, how to make repairs that will last permanently, and ways to simplify work and reduce costs without sacrificing quality; and he is always ready to explain both the functional and design reasons for any choice he makes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Clients consistenly praise Randall's attention to detail, quality of workmanship, and aversion to cutting corners, together with his excellent communication and readiness to explain every step of the design and work process along the way.
              We hope you will feel the same way!
