      We offer both restoration and new construction of decks and porches.
      We can repair rot damage, structural issues, and worn finishes, replace rotted structural framing, install decking surface, and build fences, rails, and stairs.
      Both repairs and new construction are made to last, using rot-resistant decking material and finishes, corrosion-resistant hardware, and structural framing built to minimize damage from ground and water contact.
