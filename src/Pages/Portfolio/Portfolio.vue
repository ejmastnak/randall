        <p>An upstairs bathroom fixture cracked at the worst possible time—with the homeowners travelling out of the country—leaving water flowing for days through the first floor ceiling.</p>

        <p class="mt-2">Starting from bare studs, Artisanal Restoration framed new walls and ceilings, supervised the installation of new electrical and plumbing fixtures, then exactly matched the original hardwood floor, finish carpentry, and custom 1920s moldings and trim, while uncovering and correcting structurally unsound basement framing and solving a perennially squeaky floor along the way.</p>

        <p>Extensive rot in the wooden exterior trim and window framing on the facade of a large multistory home became a serious eyesore and risked further water intrusion into the home's interior.</p>

        <p class="mt-2">Working both at ground level and on 25-foot extension ladders, Artisanal Restoration removed the rotted wood, insulated exposed cavities in the home's exterior walls, added flashing and waterproof sheathing to prevent future rot, and reframed and reinstalled exterior windows and doors, before restoring exterior trim and finish carpentry.

        <p>Artisanal Restoration removed the old stairs,  added a concrete foundation to prevent future decay from ground contact, reframed the stringers and base plate with healthy wood.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">The new structural framework was covered with beautiful mahogany treads, then topped off with a custom balustrade featuring beautiful finish carpentry details on the rail profile and newel post finials.</p>

        <p class="mt-2">Flood damage forced the homeowner to replace a section of a 1950s tongue-and-groove oak floor.
          Artisanal Restoration immediately noticed an important detail: 70 years ago, floorboards were made with slightly larger tongues and grooves than the standard 3/4" boards available today.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          To ensure the new floorboards would exactly match the existing floor, Artisanal Restoration painstakingly resawed an additional 1/16" from the grooves of the new boards, before expertly weaving them in to the existing floor—all of this after completely reframing the underlying joists and subfloor to solve a perennial squeaking problem.

        After the homeowner opted to restore a multistory deck decaying and dulling from water and sun exposure, Artisanal Restoration removed the aging surface, reframed the rotting underlying structural framework, added shims and furring strips to ensure a level deck surface, and installed new decking coordinated to match the existing brick siding.
